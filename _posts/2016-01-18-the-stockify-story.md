# The Stockify Story

Once upon a time, on a planet in the Orion spiral of the Milky Way Galaxy, the dominant life form, called human beings, developed commerce and trading and needed to sell stuff. They learnt to record all this commerce and trade using tallies and ledgers which they scratched onto animal bones or tablets of clay.

Shortly afterwards they had their first great industrial revolution where they formalised and systematised the process of making stuff on a grand industrial scale. In fact they were making and selling so much stuff that they needed a way to record it and measure it so they wrote it down in special books. This was OK for a while but they were making and selling so much stuff that they needed armies of people just to write it all down! For the people making stuff this was expensive and for the clerks, who had to write it all down, well it was a job, just not a very fulfilling one.

So the people had another industrial revolution and invented computers and software. Now they could write all their tallies and ledgers using the computers. Although computers were expensive, they weren't as expensive as people, and as long as you gave them correct instructions they didn't get bored or make mistakes.
