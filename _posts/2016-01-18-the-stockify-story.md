# The Stockify Story

**Or how to make cookies**

Once upon a time, on a planet in the Orion spiral of the Milky Way Galaxy, the dominant life form, called human beings, developed commerce and trading and needed to sell stuff. They learnt to record all this commerce and trade using tallies and ledgers which they scratched onto animal bones or tablets of clay.

Shortly afterwards they had their first great industrial revolution where they formalised and systematised the process of making stuff on a grand industrial scale. In fact they were making and selling so much stuff that they needed a way to record it and measure it so they wrote it down in special books. This was OK for a while but they were making and selling so much stuff that they needed armies of people just to write it all down! For the people making stuff this was expensive and for the clerks, who had to write it all down, well it was a job, just not a very fulfilling one.

So the people had another industrial revolution and invented computers and software. Now they could write all their tallies and ledgers using the computers. Although computers were expensive, they weren't as expensive as people, and as long as you gave them correct instructions they didn't get bored or make mistakes.

Now they could make cookies! They could sell millions them to the furthers reaches of the globe and never worry about how many clerks might be needed to tally it all because the computers and software would do all of that boring and tedious work.

But now they had another problem. Whilst they could make and sell cookies by the gazillion, they couldn't control all the bits and bobs they needed to make the cookies.

They'd have enough jam, but not enough flour.  Or they'd find out at the last minute that they had enough flour and jam but the butter was out of date. And the cookie jars they needed still hadn't been made. So they invented Inventory Management to solve these problems. But the trouble was that all the inventory management software was horrible. It was made for computer programmers to use not for clerks and production managers. 

## So we invented Stockify. Inventory Management Made Simple.

We believe in a task based approach that's a logical extension of everything else you do. Put in your suppliers, put in your parts, add in the recipes for the things you make. Order your stock and receive it when it comes in. When you make stuff, automatically adjust your inventory levels. When you sell stuff automatically adjust your stock of finished goods.
